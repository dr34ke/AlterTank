# AlterTank

The AlterTank app was created for users of alternative-powered vehicles. After setting up the vehicle in advance, it displays to the user fuel stations near him that are compatible with his vehicle, including the last recorded price. It also has a function for keeping statistics, financial or vehicle consumption or distance traveled.
